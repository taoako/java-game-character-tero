# 🎮 Data Abstraction in Java (DSA Lesson)

## 📌 What is Data Abstraction?

- **Abstraction** is the process of showing only the essential details and hiding the implementation.
- In **OOP with Java**, abstraction is usually implemented using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
- It lets us focus on _what_ an object does, not _how_ it does it.

---

## 🐾 Example: Game Characters with Abstraction

We define an **abstract class** `GameCharacter` that all characters must extend.  
It forces every character to implement `attack()` and `specialMove()`, but allows unique behaviors too.

---

## 🕹️ Sample Output

```
Character: Arthas
Arthas swings a mighty sword!
Arthas uses Shield Bash!

Character: Merlin
Merlin casts a fireball!
Merlin uses Lightning Storm!
Merlin unleashes the Secret Power: Utot 💨!!!
```

## 📝 Summary

- **Abstraction** = “Define what, hide how.”
- Abstract classes/interfaces define the **rules**.
- Subclasses provide the **details**.
- Our game example makes it clear:

  - `GameCharacter` = abstract base
  - `Warrior`, `Mage` = concrete implementations
